In a recent mail exchange with Dave Plummer, Hans Otten and Rutger van Bergen, I learned that Hal Chamberlin, designer of the K-1008 "Visable" Memory Card and other MTU products, wrote an assembly program for the MTU-130 to display the distribution of prime numbers visually.

I was having a boring afternoon, so I decided to write my own version, following Hal's description. It does not have the same historical significance, that's for sure, and is probably much less elegant than the original, but who cares.

Code at [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/eduardocasino/k-1008-sieve), mandatory video follows:
