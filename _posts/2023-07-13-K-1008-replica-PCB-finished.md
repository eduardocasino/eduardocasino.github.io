Finished the top layer too. I need to make some minor adjustments to the solder mask (not shown) and double check a couple of corrections I've made to the schematic, but this is it.

I've had to add some "frog DNA" to fill in the hidden traces, so it won't be as "identical" as I would like, but there are no pictures of a bare PCB.
