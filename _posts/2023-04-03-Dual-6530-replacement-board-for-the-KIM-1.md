While (if ever) I complete the FPGA replacement for the 6530, I've designed this daughterboard to replace both 6530 in a KIM-1 PCB. It should work also with a real KIM-1.

It has the same "hand-drawn" look as the KIM-1, so that it integrates seamlessly with it.

It has now its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1-dual-6532-adapter).
