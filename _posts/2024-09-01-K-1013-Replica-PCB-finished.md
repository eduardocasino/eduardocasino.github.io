Routing of front and back layers completed!

Everything checks against the schematic. I'm rechecking the gerbers before sending it to fabrication, but I don't expect anything major.

Time to start sourcing components. There are a few that are probematic, specially the 256x8 PROM. It is very difficult to find them NOS and, even if they are good, cheap programmers are not able to write them. Fortunately, an adatpter for common 8K EPROMs is easy to make.
