I'm working on what aims to be a faithful replica of MTU's K-1008 Visable Memory card for the KIM-1. I'm following basically the same procedure as I did for my KIM-1 Rev. D replica: reproducing the schematics from the existing documentation and using photos of the original card to correct it and to replicate the PCB, and doing all of it just with open source tools.

This is a picture of the card from Dave Plummer that he kindly sent me:

I've just completed a first version of the schematics, including some annotations an corrections, as well as the component placement and board outline. I'll be posting updates on my progress in this blog.

As always, everything is available at my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eduardocasino/k-1008-visable-memory-card-replica).

Thanks to Hans Otten for the invaluable info at his site, http://retro.hansotten.nl, and Dave Plummer for the photos and interest in this project.
