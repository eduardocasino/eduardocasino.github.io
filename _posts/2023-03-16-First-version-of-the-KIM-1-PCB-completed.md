Next steps:

* Get mounting holes in the right positions.
* Work a bit more on the footprints and solder mask to be closer to the real thing.
* Send to fabricate and start building it!
* General cleanup and make everything available on GitHub
* Create footprints to generate also revisions E to G

I've started working on FPGA replacements for the 6530-002 and 003, based on a VHDL core for the 6532 by Retromaster. My intention is to share it on GitHub when I have something that starts functioning.
