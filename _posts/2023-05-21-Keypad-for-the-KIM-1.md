I've just finished my take on the keypad. The design premises were:

* It should be a direct replacement for a rev. D (or later) keypad so it could be used in a real KIM with a missing or broken one.
* It must be a one layer design as the keyboard lays down directly on top of some traces of the KIM PCB.
* It must be usable (and look nice) without a keypad case
* It should look nearly identical to the real thing once I add a 3d-printed case (next intem on the list :wink:)
And this is the result:

Bare board

With all the components, solder mask and silkscreen:
